### if-condition :-
----------------
Conditional Logic uses specifc statements in java to allow us to check a condition and execute certain code based on whether  that condition (the expression) is True or False.

Instead of using the IF-statement as we can see here, we should instead use a CODE BLOCK>
A CODE BLOCK allows more than one statement to be executed - a block of code.

the format is:

if(expression){
	//put one or more statements here
}

###DiffMerge Tool Introduction:-
----------------------------
* DiffMerge is an program that will help you to visually compare and merge files on any operating system.

* It can be helpful with programming as well.

* Some other tools like code repositories use similar merge operations, so this will also help you in the future when you start working with code repositories.

* When you code along with the videos in course it is easy to make a typo, and get stuck, and this is where DiffMerge will help you!

* Every lesson has the code attached to it that I typed in the video and you can download a zip file with all that code.

* By downloading code from the video and comparing it with yours you will be able to easily find any errors/typos made using DiffMerge.

* With DiffMerge  you can compare a single file or even the whole folder and visually see the differencess side by side.
